<h1>I built a React App that allows users to guess the average annual precipitation totals between 2 random cities. 
<b>TRY OUT THE APP RIGHT HERE AT https://raingame.netlify.app/ </b>

<b>It's 5 randomly generated questions, and some questions are easier than others.  I am a meteorologist and I do not always get 100% correct.  Let me know how you do at pmangione39@hotmail.com</b>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
